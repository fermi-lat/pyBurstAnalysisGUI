gtBurst is a python GUI (Graphical User Interface) which can be used to analyze
Gamma-ray Bursts and Solar Flares observed by the instruments onboard the NASA
Fermi satellite (formerly known as GLAST).

IMPORTANT: gtburst is now part of the official Fermi Science Tools package (http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/software/).
